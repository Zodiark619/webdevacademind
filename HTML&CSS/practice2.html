	<p>
Join the most comprehensive web development bootcamp on Udemy!</p>
<p>This course will teach you web development and turn you into a web developer in 100 days - or allow you to refresh key essentials and expand your existing knowledge!</p>

<p>Becoming a web developer is a great choice because web development opens up many career paths and web development skills are required in pretty much every business that exists today - and of course this will only increase in the future!</p>

<p>It's not just about websites - it's also about "behind the scenes" services used by mobile apps like Uber or AirBnB. It's about rich web apps like Google Docs as well as browser games. And of course also about regular websites like Facebook, online blogs, online shops like Amazon and much, much more!</p>

<p>Hence it's no wonder, that web developers are in high demand! And, besides great job perspectives, as a web developer, you can of course also easily build your own digital business!</p>

	<h3>The 100 Days Of Code Challenge</h3>
	<p>We built this course with the "100 Days Of Code Challenge" in mind - a challenge (not invented by us) that aims to keep you motivated to code for at least 1 hour per day for 100 days.</p>
<p>Since this is a huge course (with around 80 hours of content!) it can be very overwhelming. And we know that many students never finish a course.</p>

<p>That's a pitty, because this course is packed with content, exercises, quizzes, assignments and demo projects! We build a browser-game, a blog, a travel website, an online shop and much, much more.</p>


<p>Therefore, we provide clear guidance on how you can take this course from A to Z within 100 days by spending 1 to 2 hours per day watching videos and learning. As part of the course, you get access to a companion website that provides a clear structure and you also find annotations right in the course curriculum.</p>


<p>Of course taking this "100 Days" challenge is totally optional though! You can take the course at your own pace as well and skip any content you're not interested in!</p>
